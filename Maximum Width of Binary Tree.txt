As we need to reach every node in the given tree, we will have to traverse the tree, either with a depth-first search, or with a breadth-first search.
The main idea in this question is to give each node a position value. If we go down the left neighbor, then position -> position * 2; and if we go down the right neighbor, then position -> position * 2 + 1. This makes it so that when we look at the position values L and R of two nodes with the same depth, the width will be R - L + 1.
Traverse each node in breadth-first order, keeping track of that node's position. For each depth, the first node reached is the left-most, while the last node reached is the right-most.
